##What is Telecommunications Technology?##

>**Telecommunications** are _“information exchange by means of electrical signals”_

This definition is a translation of the one given by Édouard Estaunié who was the writer that coined the term telecommunications in 1904.

But you could say that telecommunications go back much farther to 1801 with the development of the optical telegraph invented by Claude Chappe. The optical telegraph was a system of towers and wires that used positionable arms on the tops of the towers to transmit encoded messages across France.
